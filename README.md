This project focuses on leveraging U-Net-based deep learning models for detecting changes in land cover over time, which are crucial for effective environmental management and urban planning.
The project evaluates four U-Net-based architectures - Basic U-Net, Modular U-Net, U-Net++, and Light U-Net++ - for their performance in accurately delineating land cover changes.

# Applications - 

1. Accurate monitoring of agricultural land use changes to support sustainable farming.
